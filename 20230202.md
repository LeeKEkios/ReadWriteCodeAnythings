## How to merge maps

Q:>
```  Typescript
type StringMap = { [key: string]: unknown };
// `keyof StringMap` resolves to `string` here
function createStringPair(property: keyof StringMap, value: string): StringMap {
  return { [property]: value };
}
```
with this code, how can I make 'StringMap' instance has multiple keys?

A:>
You can make a StringMap instance with multiple keys by calling createStringPair multiple times and merging the resulting objects into a single object. For example:

``` javascript
const firstPair = createStringPair("key1", "value1");
const secondPair = createStringPair("key2", "value2");
const multiKeyMap = { ...firstPair, ...secondPair };
```
Here, the firstPair and secondPair objects each have a single key, and they are merged into a single multiKeyMap object that has two keys.

Alternatively, you can create the multiKeyMap object directly without using the createStringPair function:

``` javascript
const multiKeyMap = {
  key1: "value1",
  key2: "value2"
};
```
In this example, the multiKeyMap object has two keys, "key1" and "key2", with corresponding values of "value1" and "value2".

Q:>
From your answer's 1st code. `...` what is this?

A:>
The `...` operator in the code `{ ...firstPair, ...secondPair }` is called the "spread operator". It's a feature in JavaScript and TypeScript that allows you to spread the elements of an array or the properties of an object into a new array or object, respectively.

In this specific example, the spread operator is used to merge two objects, firstPair and secondPair, into a single object. The resulting object will contain all the properties from both firstPair and secondPair. If there are any conflicting property names, the property from the second object will overwrite the property from the first object.
